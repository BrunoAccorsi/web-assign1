        <p>
          Originally from Brazil, I have embarked on an enriching journey to
          Calgary, where I am pursuing my passion for software development. At
          29 years old, I find myself in the unique position of blending my
          academic pursuits with professional experience, currently working as a
          developer for a US-based company, Goodworld. This role not only allows
          me to apply my burgeoning skills in a real-world context but also
          presents an exciting challenge as I navigate the complexities of
          software development across international borders.

          Outside of my professional and academic endeavors, my interests are
          diverse and deeply enriching. A fervent enthusiast of video games and
          series, I cherish the immersive experiences they offer, allowing me to
          explore new worlds and stories from the comfort of my home. Traveling
          holds a special place in my heart, offering me a tangible way to
          satisfy my curiosity about the world. Music is another avenue of
          exploration for me, with the guitar serving as my instrument of
          choice, allowing me to express myself melodically. Amidst all these
          interests, my personal life flourishes as wellâ€”I am currently engaged,
          looking forward to starting a new chapter of my life with my partner.
